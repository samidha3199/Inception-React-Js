<!-- Day 2

1. What is an emmet?
   VS code madhe use hota./It is use in VS code.
   It bascially generated a code for u inside vs code.

2. what is difference between this 2 cdn links?
   <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
   <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

The first set of CDN links development madhe use hota jevha apan app create karto thevha.
Ani ithe tula errors, warning veregre show hota m easily apan change karu sakto according.
So hey apan jevha app create kartoy thevha use karycha

The second set of CDN links is for production means jevha apla app ready ahe create karun
ani ata to live karycha ahe thevha ani te aplyla code la minified, bundle,
unnecessary ghost remove karta. Ani ithe error warnings show nahi karat developer la
so developer cannot understand.
So hey apan jevha app create karun jhalay ani ata te live karych ahe thevha use karych

3. Order of links matter?
   Yes,
   <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
   <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
   <script src="script.js"></script>

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="script.js"></script>

4. Remove this warning?

Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the top-level render call using <div>. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.

Solution:

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

use this cdn files at the end of body

5. What is Production Ready app?
   Before our app going to production we need to do lots of things

1. We need to optimize it.
1. Bundle everything.
1. Remove unnecessary things like comments,console.
1. Minified our code.
1. Need to compress it.
1. Optimize it(means: to make as perfect, effective, or functional as possible)
1. We need to do cache.

###To do all things we need packages. And this packages makes our app faster.

6. What is NPM?
   Official: https://www.npmjs.com/
1. Npm does not stand for node package manager (u can see in offical website).
1. NPM does not have a full form.
1. NPM manages packages behind the sceens.
1. It is a standard repository for all pacakges.
1. Any pacakges u want to include in ur project u can use npm.
1. All packages,library,utility u need and hosted in npm and npm manages all that for u in ur project
1. Infact we u write create react app it automatically has npm in that u don't have to configure it.
1. Npm will manges packages that will install in our project.
1. npm will take care what is the version of that package.

1. What is Dependency?
   Packages are also known as dependency same cha ahe dhoni(same) pan

1. What is package.json file?
1. It is configuration for npm.
1. It keeps the tract of version what package is install in our project.
1. It maintain the configuration of all packages

1. What is package-lock.json file?
1. It keeps the exact of exact version of the pacakge/dependency
1. It keeps the record of every small things install in your project.
1. aplyla package la lock karta bcoz m jar update jhala tar m problem honar

What is ^(Caret) and ~(Tilde)?
^(Caret) means when new version comes it will automatically upadtes to minor means small
~(Tilde) means when new version comes it will automatically updates to major means big

9. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
   package.json: keeps the approx version of package we install in our project.
   pacakge-lock.json: keeps the exact version of package we install in our project.

##Install Dependency in our project
##The most important package which we are going to use is bundler.

10. Bundler
1. Our whole code need to be bundle together like HTMl,css,js files everything.
1. our whole code need to be minified, cache, compressed, clean before send it to production.
1. All this things are done by bundler.
1. Webpack,parcel,vite,browserify, roll up, ESBuild, etc
1. So bundler packages our app/ bundle our app and shift to production.
1. For example: when we write create react app behind the sceens uses
   webpack bundler to build things up.

\*\*Note: All bundler are same. But they work differently. We are going to use parcel.

11. What is Transitive Dependency
    Means 1 ghost dusrya varti depend ahe ani te dusrya varti depend ahe ani hey pan dusrya varti depend
    package1 > depend on > packge 2 > depend on > package 3 > ...
    So one pacakge/dependecy on another pacakge/dependency and this is depend on another.
    Eg: Our project is depend on parcel and parcel is depend on lots of other things and this things
    are also depend on another things.

12. What is Parcel?
13. Parcel has its own dependency.
14. Parcel cannot do anything on own there are lots of things(package) which help parcel to do it.
15. Parcel is a bundler.
16. Parcel creates a local server for your project. It host our app to local server.
17. It automatically refreshing our page. When we save our code it auto reload it on browser
    this is done bcoz of HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
18. Parcel uses file watching algorithm(written in C++).
    means it read our code. keeps an eye on every files.
19. Parcel build our app faster because it is doing caching.
    Where it is doing caching?
    parcel-cache folder ahe te bgh.
20. Parcel do image optimization.
    means:
    (process of creating and delivering high-quality images in the right format,
    dimension, and resolution for whatever device is accessing them,
    all while keeping the smallest possible file size.)
21. Parcel will minified our code.
22. Parcel will do bundle our code.
23. Parcel will also compress our files so that we can moved to production.
    It will remove all white spaces(extra space astat te).
24. when we do npx create app tithe pan bts madhe parcel use hota.
25. Parcel uses consistency hashing.
26. It does code splitting for you.
27. It does differential bundling.
    means: when u r app will be hosted
    ur app can be open on old browser, chrome, interet explorer, firefox, etc
    so parcel will take care of this and parcel will give u differential bundling to your app
    so that your app can work smoothly on anywhere.
    parcel will give u different bundler to work on different types of app, browsers.
28. Diagnostics
    means: If you make an error in your code or configuration,
    Parcel displays beautiful diagnostics in your terminal and in the browser.
29. Tree Shaking - means remove unnecessary code for u
    Official Websites: https://parceljs.org/

##React uses a lot of other things to make our app faster, optimize scalable etc

13. cache means?
    Hardware or software that is used to store something, usually data,
    temporarily in a computing environment.
    It is a small amount of faster, more
    expensive memory used to improve the performance of recently or frequently accessed data.

14. What is Babel?
    It is normal js pacakge
    It job is to tranpiled our jsx code that react understood

15. What is CORS?
    eg: 1 library ahe tyacha madhe khup jaan books gheun jatat pan mi asa v4 kela
    ki mala library ajun kadyche ahet lok javal cha thikani books gheun jatil
    so main ahe tyala orgin server boltat
    jo javal/franchesis cha ahe tyala bolnar CDN edge server
    jo delivery pass kar rahe hai vo CDN
    Crossorgin ch kaam ahe je user authorize ahe tyanach books denar.
    So crossorigin job is to check the user is authorize/authenticate or not ani jar authenticate
    nasel tar it will give u an error.

16. When we write js we don't put cdn but when we write react why we use/put cdn links
    When writing plain JavaScript, you may not need a CDN because
    it's a core language supported by browsers.
    React, being a library, is often distributed through CDNs for easier integration,
    faster loading, and version control in web projects.

17. What is NPX?
    jar tujhi 1 library ahe te tu assume kar te npm ahe
    m tujha library madhe mazine nahi ahe m te tula banvavi lagnar
    so instead of creating it u can borrow it from someone
    so apan npx borrow kartoy npm madhun
    run packages without installing it
    which allows us to run JavaScript packages without installing it
    npx is a tool that comes with Node.js, and it allows you to run Node.js packages (commands) directly without installing them globally.

HomeWork Day 2:

1. How many package.json and package-lock.json is there in our production code
2. Do we put node_module in github and do we put package.json and package-Lock.json?
3. Which files we don't put on github
4. je pan apan files regenerate karu sakto te apan github varti nahi takat
5. What is dB dependency and dev dependency
6. What is parcel cache
7. What is Hot Module Replacement/What is Hot Reloading (same nahi ahe)
8. What are 5 superpowers of parcel? list any 3 in details
9. What should be add and not add in gitignore
10. Task:
    .gitignore file create and push in github

Task:

Create github acc SSH key n all do

Make this github repository

git init

Now u have main branch as Master u have to make it as main

git branch -M main

Create README.md file

Push all the code on github

git add .

git commit -m "mesage here"

Now u push but it does not know the remote

git remote add origin git@github.com:samidha3199/React-JS.git -->
